# blockhouseOADjango
A simple Django server that serves data to blockhouseOANextJS

# Steps to run the project
1) pip3 install -r requirements.txt
2) python3 manage.py runserver

This should start the server on http://127.0.0.1:8080/

NOTE: Need to run server before UI, as UI needs data from the server.
